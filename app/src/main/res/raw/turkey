Ingredients:
1 cup corn kernels, or frozen (thawed)
½ cup chopped fresh tomato
Tomatoes Regular
¼ cup chopped soft sun-dried tomatoes
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 tablespoon red-wine vinegar or cider vinegar
8 thin slices low-sodium deli turkey (about 8 ounces)
4 8-inch whole-wheat tortillas
2 cups chopped romaine lettuce


Preparation:
Combine corn, tomato, sun-dried tomatoes, oil and vinegar in a medium bowl.
Divide turkey among tortillas.
Top with equal portions of the corn salad and lettuce.
Roll up. Serve the wraps cut in half, if desired.
Tip: To remove corn kernels from the cob, stand an ear of corn on one end and slice the kernels off with a sharp knife.
One ear will yield about ½ cup kernels.
Shopping Tip: Look for soft sun-dried tomatoes (not oil-packed) in the produce section of most supermarkets.
If you can only find dry (and hard) sun-dried tomatoes, soak them in boiling water for about 20 minutes before using.
Eat neat: Keeping the filling inside a wrap or burrito can be a challenge, especially if you're on the go.
That's why we recommend wrapping your burrito in foil so you can pick it up and eat it without losing the filling,
peeling back the foil as you go.
