Ingredients:
6 ounces whole-wheat spaghetti
12 ounces peeled and deveined raw shrimp (see Note), cut into 1-inch pieces
1 bunch asparagus, trimmed and thinly sliced
Asparagus Fresh$2.97Thru 11/18
1 large red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1 cup fresh or frozen peas
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1¼ teaspoons kosher salt
1½ cups nonfat or low-fat plain yogurt
Chobani Greek Yogurt 0% Fat, Plain$4.98Thru 11/18
¼ cup chopped flat-leaf parsley
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
½ teaspoon freshly ground pepper
¼ cup toasted pine nuts (see Tip; optional)

Preparation:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
Add spaghetti and cook 2 minutes less than package directions.
Add shrimp, asparagus, bell pepper and peas and cook until the pasta is tender and the shrimp are cooked, 2 to 4 minutes more.
Drain well. Mash garlic and salt in a large bowl until a paste forms.
Whisk in yogurt, parsley, lemon juice, oil and pepper. Add the pasta mixture and toss to coat.
Serve sprinkled with pine nuts (if using).
Both wild-caught and farm-raised shrimp can damage the surrounding ecosystems when not managed properly.
Look for shrimp certified by an independent agency, such as Wild American Shrimp or Marine Stewardship Council.
If you can't find certified shrimp, choose wild-caught shrimp from North America—it's more likely to be sustainably caught.
To toast pine nuts, place in a small dry skillet and cook over medium-low heat, stirring, until fragrant, 2 to 4 minutes.
