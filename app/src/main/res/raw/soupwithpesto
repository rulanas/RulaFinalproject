Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
Add carrot (or bell pepper) and chicken; cook, turning the chicken and stirring frequently,
until the chicken begins to brown, 3 to 4 minutes.
Add garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute more.
Stir in broth and marjoram; bring to a boil over high heat.
Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through,
about 5 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken pieces to a clean cutting board to cool.
Add spinach and beans to the pot and bring to a gentle boil.
Cook for 5 minutes to blend the flavors.
Combine the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, Parmesan and basil in a food processor (a mini processor works well).
Process until a coarse paste forms, adding a little water and scraping down the sides as necessary.
Cut the chicken into bite-size pieces.
Stir the chicken and pesto into the pot.
Season with pepper. Heat until hot.
Garnish with croutons, if desired.
