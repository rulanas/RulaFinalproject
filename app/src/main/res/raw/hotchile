Ingredients:
4 poblano peppers
1 14-ounce can pinto beans, preferably low-sodium3 tablespoons prepared salsa
⅛ teaspoon salt
½ cup shredded Monterey Jack or Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons low-fat plain yogurt
Chobani Greek Yogurt 0% Fat
3 scallions, sliced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
8 slices sourdough bread


Preparation:
Place peppers in a microwave-safe bowl, cover with plastic wrap and microwave on High until soft, 3 to 4 minutes.
Let stand, covered, until cool enough to handle.
Meanwhile, combine beans, salsa and salt in a medium bowl.
Mash the beans with a fork until they begin to form a paste (some can remain whole).
Combine cheese, yogurt, scallions and cilantro in a small bowl.
When the peppers are cool enough to handle, slice each one in half lengthwise and remove the stem and seeds.
Heat a panini maker to high. (No panini maker? See Stovetop Variation, below.)
Spread ⅓ cup of the bean mixture on each of 4 slices of bread.
Top with a heaping tablespoon of the cheese mixture.
Place 2 pepper halves over the cheese.
Cover with the remaining slices of bread.
Grill the sandwiches in the panini maker until golden brown, about 4 minutes.
Cut in half and serve immediately.
Stovetop Variation: Place four 15-ounce cans and a medium skillet (not nonstick) by the stove.
Heat 1 teaspoon canola oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.
Place 2 sandwiches in the pan. Place the medium skillet on top of the sandwiches, then weight it down with the cans.
Cook the sandwiches until golden on one side, about 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low, flip the sandwiches,
replace the top skillet and cans, and cook until the second side is golden, 1 to 3 minutes more.
Repeat with another 1 teaspoon oil and the remaining 2 sandwiches.
Note: Dark green poblano peppers, smaller than a bell pepper but larger than a jalapeño,
can be fiery or relatively mild; there's no way to tell until you taste them.
Find them near other fresh peppers at most large supermarkets.
