Ingredients:
½ cup finely chopped onion
Onions Yellow/ Brown$2.24Thru 11/18
¼ cup dry whole-wheat breadcrumbs (see Tip)
¾ teaspoon salt, divided
½ teaspoon freshly ground pepper
¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
¼ teaspoon ground cardamom (optional)8 ounces ground turkey breast
8 ounces ground pork
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 pound button mushrooms, sliced
1 14-ounce can reduced-sodium chicken broth
¼ cup all-purpose flour
½ cup reduced-fat sour cream
¼ cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley1 tablespoon lingonberry or seedless raspberry jam

Preparation:
Combine onion, bread crumbs, ¼ teaspoon salt, pepper, nutmeg and cardamom (if using) in a large bowl.
Add turkey and pork; gently mix to combine (do not overmix).
Using a scant 2 tablespoons for each, make about 20 meatballs.
Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.
Add the meatballs and cook, turning occasionally and reducing the heat if the pan gets too hot, until almost cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes.
 Transfer to a plate.
Add mushrooms to the pan and increase heat to medium-high.
Cook, stirring occasionally, until their liquid has been released and evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes.
Whisk broth and flour in a bowl and add to the pan along with the meatballs.
Bring to a simmer and cook until the meatballs are just cooked through and the sauce is thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat.
Add sour cream, parsley, jam and the remaining ½ teaspoon salt to the sauce; gently stir until combined.
